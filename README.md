Thunder the Robot

Anyone who wishes to try out Thunder the Robot, should download an install set for their
particular OS.

NOTE:  All the executables provided are 64-bit executables.  

For all platforms, use the OS file explorer and navigate to the directory/folder into
which this download is placed.

Linux users:  To install the application, click on the thunderLINUX-setup
              file to launch a text-based installer.  Installation default
   	      location is /opt/Thunder.  You will need to augment your PATH
	      to reference the executable.  For those who have a directory
	      such as /usr/share/applications in which .desktop files are 
	      located, create one for Thunder.  Please note that the graphical
	      image for the executable is in the location /opt/Thunder/buffalo1.png.

MAC users:    To install the application, retrieve the Thunder.app.zip file and
              extract the app from the archive.  Then simply copy Thunder.app 
              over to your Applications folder.

Windows users: To install the application, retrieve thunder-setup.exe to some
	       appropriate location on your computer and then click on thunder-setup.exe
               to launch the installer.  You may choose where you wish the app
               to install.  For the simplest install, simply click Install
               when the installer prompts.<br /><br />
	       For those Windows users without administrative privileges, retrieve
	       Thunder-win-portable.zip and extract its contents to some appropriate
	       location (including a flash/thumb drive).  Extraction will create the
	       folder Thunder-win-portable.  Navigate into that folder and click on
	       Thunder.exe to launch the application.

That's it.  The application has the same look and feel on all the above platforms.

NOTE:  All install sets were created using Excelsior Jet.
