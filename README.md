Thunder the Robot

To execute the jar file, one needs to have the Oracle Java 1.8 runtime
installed.  If you do not have that, navigate to:

https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/install/install_overview.html

It is not known whether thunder executes successfully using Open JDK's Iced
Tea run time.

Given that the latest Oracle Java Run Time (JRE) is installed, then there 
should be a file association with .jar files.  Simply navigate your file
explorer (Linux, Windows, Mac) to point to the thunder.jar file, 
double-click on it, and the application will launch.

If you have any difficulties, please contact me at hhaiduk@wtamu.edu
and provide me as much information as you can about your situation.

NOTE: If you are running a Linux without a GUI, then you should be able 
to enter the command:

    java -jar thunder.jar

assuming that the java executable is in your system PATH.
