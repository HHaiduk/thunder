Thunder the Robot

To execute the jar file, one should have a Java runtime (JRE) installed.  
Please note that Oracle's Java Development Kit version 8 was used for all 
development of this app.  Testing has revealed that this application also
works well with Open JRE version 7 and 8.

If you do not have a JRE installed (or your version is old), navigate to:

https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/install/install_overview.html

Given that the latest Oracle Java Run Time (JRE) is installed, then there 
should be a file association with .jar (Java ARchive) files.  Simply 
navigate your file explorer (Linux, Windows, Mac) to point to the 
thunder.jar file, double-click on it, and the application will launch.

If you have any difficulties, please contact me at hhaiduk@wtamu.edu
and provide me as much information as you can about your situation.

NOTE: If you are running a Linux without a GUI, then you should be able 
to enter the command:

    java -jar thunder.jar

assuming that the java executable is in your system PATH.
