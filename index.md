# Thunder the Robot
## A Gentle Introduction to the Art of Programming 

This is a software product that evolved over many years. It's original inspiration came from a book entitled _Karel the Robot: A Gentle Introduction to the Art of Pascal Programming_ originally published in 1981 by John Wiley and Sons and authored by Richard Pattis. H. Paul Haiduk was so taken by the power of this approach to teaching the fundamentals of algorithmic thinking and programming that he ported one of the early versions of Pattis' software written in Pascal over to a Hewlett-Packard 3000 Series computer and used that implementation to support teaching programming for a number of years. Most recently, this software was re-inspired by Guido van Robot. Unfortunately, the Guido Implementation has not seen additional development since 2010. In addition, the graphical presentation of the robot's world made it difficult to discern just where the robot was in its world.

Thus, the idea is not new -- what is new is the method of delivery.

This presentation of Thunder the Robot is written in Java and converted to native code for Linux, MAC and MS Windows. 
Conversion was made possible by use of [Excelsior JET](https://www.excelsiorjet.com).  This version of Thunder the Robot 
was developed using Oracle's Java Development Kit (JDK) version 1.8, or Java 8 as it is known, and the NetBeans 
development environment. Features include:

- graphical world editor
- explosion effects when robot runs into a wall
- an editor with syntax highlighting and choice of fonts and font sizes
- real-time execution highlighter

Paraphrased from promotional text from the publisher of original concept: . . . the Robot teaches students the fundamental
concepts and skills of programming - quickly and easily! By emphasizing logic and structure over calculation, it provides a
non-threatening introduction to the central ideas in programming - the same ideas that apply to all computer programming
languages. The software provides a literal-minded robot whose built-in capabilities allow it to explore its world and
manipulate simple objects in it. This software supports a programming language that is a pre-cursor to Python. The 
programming language emphasizes logical deduction and spatial reasoning rather than calculation and algebraic reasoning. 
Once students learn the details of Thunder's deceptively simple programming language, they will soon be designing 
well-structured programs that instruct Thunder to perform surprisingly complex tasks. Along the way, they will be absorbing
sophisticated programming concepts that will enhance their programming ability! Note that there are NO variables in 
Thunder's language.

For the time being, the single best text for making best use of this software is _Karel the Robot: A Gentle Introduction to the Art of
Programming, Second Edition_ by Richard E. Pattis and revised by Jim Roberts and Mark Stehlik. (C) 1995 by John Wiley & Sons,
 Inc. ISBN-10: 0-471-59725-2. Book is 160 pages in paperback.

Due to the overwhelming interest in use Thunder the Robot, H. Paul Haiduk is now working on a book (along with problems and suggested solutions) to accompany this software.  Plans are to complete the book by December 2017.
